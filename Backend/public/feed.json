In this video, Yufeng Guo introduces Keras Recommenders (KerasRS), a library designed to help developers build reliable ranking and retrieval models with ease.\n\nWe’ll walk through a complete code example using the MovieLens dataset to build a Sequential Retrieval model. Using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to analyze a user's watch history, we will predict exactly which movie they are likely to watch next.\n\nBecause KerasRS is built on Keras 3, this workflow is compatible with your choice of backend: TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch.\n\nIn this video, you will learn:\n- What Keras Recommenders is and why it’s useful\n- How to prepare sequential data (using the \"snake\" method) for training\n- How to build a two-tower architecture with a query tower (GRU) and candidate tower\n- How to use the BruteForceRetrieval layer for accurate predictions\n\nResources:\nBuild and train a recommender system in 10 minutes using Keras and JAX  → https://goo.gle/44VVj1J   \nKeras Recommenders Documentation → https://goo.gle/495DAG9 \nCheck out the Code Example → https://goo.gle/3KBM140 \n\nChapters: \n0:00 - Introduction: LLMs vs. Keras Recommenders \n0:40 - What is KerasRS? \n2:09 - Installation & Setup \n3:04 - Sequential Retrieval & GRU Explained \n4:30 - Preparing the MovieLens Dataset \n6:35 - Data Batching & Structure \n7:17 - Building the Two-Tower Model \n8:14 - Making Movie Predictions \n8:28 - Conclusion & Next Steps\n\n#Keras #MachineLearning #Recommenders \n\nSubscribe to Google for Developers → https://goo.gle/developers \n\nSpeaker: Yufeng Guo\nProducts Mentioned: Google AI",

    "description": "You know that debugging is crucial when doing any kind of software development. JAX and Flax NNX offer amazing performance and a clean API, but debugging can feel different due to JAX's compilation model. Today, we'll bridge the gap, exploring how to debug JAX and NNX effectively, relating techniques back to your PyTorch experience. We'll focus specifically on the Flax NNX API.  This is the first episode of a three episode series on debugging.  This episode introduces the core problem of JAX's JIT compilation and presents the most direct, fundamental tools for inspecting runtime values, introducing the basics for anyone new to JAX debugging.  \n\nResources: \nLearn more → https://goo.gle/learning-jax\n\nSubscribe to Google for Developers → https://goo.gle/developers \n\nSpeaker: Robert Crowe",
