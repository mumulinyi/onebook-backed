    "description": "Do I need a perfect accent to be successful? Let's talk about mindset.\n\nI’m an English teacher, but I’m also a language learner. In this short, I share my honest experience learning Spanish as an adult (over 50). I'm not trying to learn as fast as possible, and I don’t aim for a \"perfect\" accent but rather accurate pronunciation. I focus on achieving successful communication, understanding others, and being understood — while keeping my sense of identity.\n\nAim to know more than you did yesterday. And keep going!\n\nThis message is for English learners (and all language learners) who experience pressure to sound exactly like a native. No one has \"perfect\" pronunciation. We all have some kind of accent. An accent does not prevent you from communicating well. And progress doesn’t have to be fast to be meaningful. You can learn a language, enjoy the process, and succeed...even with an accent.\n\nFocus on having clear speech and continue to master enough grammar and vocabulary to express yourself.\n\nWatch more videos on building a healthy learner mindset.\n▶️https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfQSN9FlyB6Qh6CF7OJZaxyPRNSxNIAos\n\n#EnglishWithJennifer\n#LanguageLearning\n#LearnEnglish\n#LanguageLearner\n#AccentConfidence\n#AdultLanguageLearning\n#LanguageMindset\n\n✨Are you an advanced student? ✨Would you like LIVE instruction every month and meaningful practice with my feedback?\nJoin me on Patreon as a Lifelong Learner. 👉http://patreon.com/englishwithjennifer \n❇️Group Zoom classes \n❇️Exclusive practice tasks\n❇️ Bonus listening materials (movie reviews, comprehension quizzes, etc.)\n❇️Access the archive of previous posts.

    "description": "Building a recommendation system that is high-quality, high-performance, and hallucination-free can be a challenge. In this video, Yufeng Guo introduces Keras Recommenders (KerasRS), a library designed to help developers build reliable ranking and retrieval models with ease.\n\nWe’ll walk through a complete code example using the MovieLens dataset to build a Sequential Retrieval model. Using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to analyze a user's watch history, we will predict exactly which movie they are likely to watch next.\n\nBecause KerasRS is built on Keras 3, this workflow is compatible with your choice of backend: TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch.\n\nIn this video, you will learn:\n- What Keras Recommenders is and why it’s useful\n- How to prepare sequential data (using the \"snake\" method) for training\n- How to build a two-tower architecture with a query tower (GRU) and candidate tower\n- How to use the BruteForceRetrieval layer for accurate predictions\n\nResources:\nBuild and train a recommender system in 10 minutes using Keras and JAX  → https://goo.gle/44VVj1J   \nKeras Recommenders Documentation → https://goo.gle/495DAG9 \nCheck out the Code Example → https://goo.gle/3KBM140 \n\nChapters: \n0:00 - Introduction: LLMs vs. Keras Recommenders \n0:40 - What is KerasRS? \n2:09 - Installation & Setup \n3:04 - Sequential Retrieval & GRU Explained \n4:30 - Preparing the MovieLens Dataset \n6:35 - Data Batching & Structure \n7:17 - Building the Two-Tower Model \n8:14 - Making Movie Predictions \n8:28 - Conclusion & Next Steps\n\n#Keras #MachineLearning #Recommenders \n\nSubscribe to Google for Developers → https://goo.gle/developers \n\nSpeaker: Yufeng Guo\nProducts Mentioned: Google AI",

    "description": "How do you grapple with national history, legacy, and the stories you tell yourself? Clint Smith is the author of the narrative nonfiction, How the Word is Passed, and the poetry collection, Above Ground. Clint joins Chris to talk about the cognitive dissonances that shaped American history. From understanding the complexities of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote “all men are created equal” while enslaving over 600 people – to reflecting on growing up in New Orleans – a major site for domestic slave trades, Clint urges you to examine historical contradictions. He also discusses his love for poetry and why it’s crucial to teach joyous moments in Black history too. So students won’t see slavery and Jim Crow as the totality of the black historical experience but can envision themselves of possibilities beyond subjugation.\n\nJoin us in person at a TED conference: https://tedtalks.social/events\nBecome a TED Member to support our mission: https://ted.com/membership\nSubscribe to a TED newsletter: https://ted.com/newsletters\n\nFollow TED! \nX: https://www.twitter.com/TEDTalks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ted\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/TED\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks\n\nThe TED Talks channel features talks, performances and original series from the world's leading thinkers and doers.

In my experience Preply is a great way to take your language learning to the next level!\n\nIn this English lesson I'll help you learn everyday phrases about timing, opportunity, and advantage. These are expressions English speakers use when talking about starting early, waiting too long, getting ahead, or falling behind in real life.\n\nIn this English class you’ll learn clear meanings and real examples for phrases like to beat the rush, to miss the boat, the early bird gets the worm, too little too late, to beat the crowd, to be late to the party, first come first served, you snooze you lose, to be ahead of the game, to drag your feet, to be a step ahead, to be two steps behind, to get a head start, to play catch-up, to get started right away, to procrastinate, to have an edge, and to be at a disadvantage. These phrases are extremely common in work, school, travel, and everyday English conversations.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to talk confidently about decisions, timing, preparation, and results using natural English expressions. You’ll sound clearer, more fluent, and more confident when describing real-life situations where timing really matters.\n\nThanks for watching, and enjoy this practical English lesson!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

    "description": "In this English lesson, you’ll learn common phrases that English speakers use to talk about everyday annoying situations. These are the little problems that can mess up your schedule, slow things down, or quietly push your patience to its limit. Learning these expressions will help you explain real-life frustrations in a clear, natural way.\n\nIn this class, we’ll cover phrases like: locked out, running late for work, stuck in traffic, and oversleeping. You’ll also learn how to talk about things such as a power outage, missing the bus, spilling coffee, losing your keys, a dead phone battery, forgetting your wallet, and other small but irritating moments.\n\nBy the end of the lesson, you’ll be ready to describe life’s everyday annoyances more confidently and sound more natural in English conversations. I hope you enjoy this useful English lesson focused on common frustrating situations.\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

    "description": "Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob. Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, it can be used as one. There are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on, and a complete English transcript in the description below.\n\nSo you might be wondering what's going on. Number one, it's not Wednesday today, it's Tuesday, as you watch this probably. And number, two, you might be thinking, I thought these videos, these Wednesdays with Bobs, were for members only. Well, this week is really, really busy for me and I didn't really have time to make an English lesson. And I didn't really have time to also make a Wednesdays with Bob. So I thought I would kill two birds with one stone.\n\nIn English, when you kill two birds with one stone, it means you get one thing done. You get two things done at the same time. Am I explaining that properly? It means that as I make this Wednesdays with Bob, I'm also going to put it out as my Tuesday video this week. So all of you who, who are members, thank you for supporting the channel. All of you who aren't members. This is one of, the things. This video is one of the things that members get, almost every Wednesday, actually I think 46 or 47 times out of the year, I do a Wednesdays with Bob video.\n\nAnd what do I talk about in a Wednesdays with Bob video? Well, sometimes I just talk about the weather. I talk about how we have a little bit of snow here on the farm. I might talk about how it's really cold out here today. It's actually minus eight right now. I should probably be wearing, probably be wearing a winter hat. I also talk about my life and things that are going on.\n\nOne of the reasons why I'm busy is I need to go to work tonight. I have to go to work tonight to be recognized for working at the school for 25 years. I don't know if it's just going to be a little presentation. I don't know if I'm going to get a gift. But, I have to go to work, tonight.\n\nAnd, last Friday night I actually had to chaperone a school dance. When you chaperone something as a teacher or as an adult, you are, responsible for, the behavior of the students who are at that event. So there was a school dance. I chaperoned it late Friday night. I still don't feel like I've fully recovered from that. I still feel pretty tired.\n\nAnd then I have to go back to work tonight. But, it is, I guess me and a few other teachers are being recognized, for our years of service.\n\nYou might be wondering, do I ever talk about the chickens? Well, sometimes I do. The chickens actually at some point need to go into the barn. It's not too cold out here for them. They are protected from the wind. But I think this weekend we'll be moving them into the barn and they'll have a much more enjoyable place to be.\n\nI'm trying to find Jen, but she's running away from me. She's, she's trying. I tried to hide from you, you're trying to hide from me. I'm killing two birds with one stone. I'm doing a Wednesdays with Bob, but then I'm going to release it Tuesday to everybody. So then I don't have to worry about, getting that done. I was just explaining how busy I am. Oh, and there's Walter. So, do you have anything to say to my wonderful audience? It's cold. It is cold. I wasn't ready for this. Yes, it's definitely colder than we expected.\n\nWhere am I at here? Oh, I've already talked for too long. I better wrap this up. So I'll walk away now. Anyways, this is what Wednesdays with Bob is. It's me rambling and there actually is some English to learn. If you want to learn a bit of English with this video. I've probably talked too long to include the whole transcript in the description at this point. So I will.\n\nAre you racing me? So, so I'll probably put a link to the full transcript in the description below and you can use it as you see fit.\n\nBy the way, here's how you could use a video like this to learn English. You could read the transcript and then watch the video. You could watch the video with the subtitles on, then read the transcript and then watch the video again with the subtitles off. You can add a lot of variation. You can do this with other English speaking YouTube channels as well. And it just helps you, the repetition helps you to remember.\n\nAnyways, thanks to all my members for being members and thanks to all the rest of you for watching my English lessons so faithfully every week. It has really helped me, to just have a lot of fun and enjoyment and to earn a bit of a living doing YouTube. So it's been fun and it's still fun. I'm not quitting or anything like that.\n\nSo anyways, have a good day. I'll see you hopefully, next week with an actual English lesson. But I'll for sure see you this Friday with a live English lesson. Bye.\n\n--\n✅ If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join",

In this first part we’ll be focusing on the fundamental differences between NumPy and JAX, highlighting the performance gains and design principles that make JAX a compelling choice for high-performance computing.  \n\nResources: \nLearn more → https://goo.gle/learning-jax\n\nSubscribe to Google for Developers → https://goo.gle/developers \n\nSpeaker: Robert Crowe",

    "description": "The secret to reducing childhood anxiety is actually quite simple: just let kids do more stuff on their own, says Lenore Skenazy, cofounder and president of Let Grow, an organization dedicated to normalizing childhood independence. In conversation with TED’s Whitney Pennington Rodgers, Skenazy discusses why parenting has become more demanding in our safety-obsessed world — and offers a more joyful, trusting alternative to helicopter parenting, with tangible steps for how to start safely (and sanely) letting your kids grow.

    "description": "Spoken English is FAST! It’s true. If you’re practicing English speaking at a slow/academic pace you’re not preparing in the best way possible. Speaking English accurately at a fast conversational pace is what most students are hoping to do. The problem is that most students learn to speak slowly. They mistakenly think that speaking slowly and accurately will make them sound more native. In fact, speaking English like a native speaker involves speeding up–both in your rate of speech and comprehension skills! My method for teaching students fast English is comprehensive and efficient. Yes, it can be difficult. But speaking English fast and understanding conversations among native speakers is possible.

    "description": "The Play It, Say It method is the most powerful took for improving spoken English. It’s embedded throughout the method I’ve used to successfully help thousands of students radically re-shape their English accent. Once you’ve used it to improve your spoken English you’ll wish you’d started sooner! Spoken English is quite different from reading in writing in English. In fact most non-native, fully-fluent students still have miles to go with spoken English. It requires a specific set of skills. And to gain those spoken English skills using my method is critical.

    "description": "What is an appositive?\nIn this quick grammar lesson, I explain how an appositive helps rename and clarify the subject of a sentence. (Appositives can actually rename any noun, but we'll focus on subjects in this short lesson.)\n\nYou’ll see clear examples featuring my colleague, a global knowledge entertainer who teaches English through rhythm and rhyme. Do you know him? Jason Levine!\nWe look at appositives like:\n✔ Jason Levine, a global knowledge entertainer, teaches through rhythm and rhyme. (commas used because this is additional information)\n✔ My friend Jase is good at raps and chants. (no commas used because his name explains \"my friend\" -- it's necessary information)\n\nYou’ll also learn a common mistake to avoid: using an unnecessary object pronoun after a proper noun. This lesson can help B1+ English learners who want clearer, more natural grammar. Communicate better with standard English grammar!\n\nTry writing your own sentence with an appositive in the comments! Be careful with your use of commas.

    "description": "In this English lesson, you’ll learn some useful phrases that include the word “step.” These expressions show up often in everyday conversations, and understanding them will help you sound more natural and confident. You'll learn at how to talk about progress, encouragement, and new beginnings.\n\nIn this English lesson I'll teach you phrases such as step by step, every step of the way, to take the first step, and one step at a time. These expressions are perfect when you want to talk about learning, completing tasks, or supporting someone. They help you describe how progress happens slowly, carefully, and with patience.\n\nWe’ll also explore phrases about confidence and improvement, including step out of your comfort zone and a step in the right direction. These are great for talking about personal goals and small actions that lead to big results.\n\nBy the end of the lesson, you’ll understand what each phrase means and how to use them naturally in your own English conversations.\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

Sustainable strategist Mohamed A. Sultan reveals how local communities are turning this crisis into opportunity, diverting hundreds of tons of waste from landfills and helping thousands of farmers adopt more sustainable techniques.

    "description": "Here is an interesting English phrase that we use when we want to express putting more effort or showing extra motivation to help someone or do something. The phrase I'm talking about is 'go the extra mile'. This particular phrase is often used when we want to express doing much more than is actually needed. To go that extra mile means to put yourself out\rmore than you normally would. When we say 'put yourself out', we mean you are going to extra trouble to do something. Perhaps you have a plan, but instead you decide to help your neighbour move some furniture. You are putting yourself out\rfor your neighbour. You might also say that you are going the extra mile. You don't have to do that particular thing, but you decide that \rit is a good thing to do. Despite the fact that it will cause you some inconvenience, in your job, you might go the extra mile to make your boss happy. You put more effort into your work\rthan you actually need to. Sometimes there is a reason\rwhy a person will go the extra mile. Perhaps that person wants to appear\rkind and generous. Maybe they want to make a good impression\ron others. In both of those situations,\ryou will try to go the extra mile. We can also say that a person 'goes that extra mile'. They will do more than is necessary. You can 'go the extra mile' or 'go that extra mile'. Both forms of the phrase\r mean the same thing.\nOf course, going the extra mile is not always a selfish action. However, if you want to be\nnoticed and liked, then sometimes it is necessary to go that extra mile. A little extra effort can go a long way.\n\n(About Mr Duncan)\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years. Have fun learning English as a second language.

    "description": "One of the best ways to test your English comprehension is to listen to a few jokes. Jokes hold meaning on two levels. They have literal meaning, which most can understand, and they have a secondary meaning which is what makes them funny. As an English learner, if you can understand why a joke is funny, it means your ability to understand English is very well developed.\n\nIn this English lesson I will tell you two longer jokes that were first told to me by my uncle when I was a kid. I've also included on dad joke as well.\n\nI hope these jokes help you learn a bit more English, and maybe you can even try to tell one of these jokes to an English speaking friend.

    "description": "Before algorithms ruled our feeds, the internet was a mess — glitchy, chaotic and full of unexpected magic. Internet culture writer Michael Sun reflects on the wild digital world of the 2000s — and makes a funny, wry case for why we need to reclaim its spontaneity, weirdness and genuine connection. From niche Facebook groups to loading music onto your iPod, it might be time to borrow from the past.

While world leaders haggle over finances at endless summits, rising temperatures will kill millions in the poorest countries by the end of this century.

    "description": "In this English lesson, you’ll learn how to talk about bad weather in a casual, everyday way and also in a more formal way you might hear on the news. \n\nWhen it’s raining or snowing, we use all kinds of expressions to describe how awful it feels outside. You’ll hear people say things like “It’s miserable out there,” “What a gross day,” or “It’s a crappy day.” These are all informal ways to describe bad weather when you’re chatting with friends or coworkers.\n\nYou’ll also learn how to sound more formal when talking about weather conditions. In the news or in official announcements, people often use terms like “adverse weather conditions” or “inclement weather.” These phrases are useful in reports, emails, or work situations where you need to sound professional or polite, even when the weather is terrible!\n\nFinally, we’ll look at common actions and phrases people use during rain or snow. When it rains, you might “get caught in the rain” or “be drenched” by the time you get home. In snowy weather, you could “go in the ditch” or “slip and fall” on the ice. You’ll even learn sports expressions like “a rain delay” or “to be rained out.”\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll be ready to describe any kind of rainy or snowy day in both formal and informal English!\n\nI hope you enjoy this English lesson about bad weather!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

    "description": "Take my FREE course to improve your American English here: https://tinyurl.com/free-course-921\n\n🎃 Happy (almost) Halloween! In this special edition Ben Franklin exercise® we’re taking a short conversation clip from the movie *Scream* and diving deep in to how Americans really speak.  \n\nIf you’re a moderate to advanced English learner ready to move beyond mere fluency into conversational native-sound speech, this lesson is for you.\n\nIn this video you’ll learn how stress, tempo, reductions, linking, schwas and placement all combine to give spoken American English its unique rhythm and sound. We’ll use phonetic symbols (IPA) and on-screen notation so you can visually see how the native speaker pronounces each word and phrase!\n\n📌 What you’ll get:\n- A short real native speaker dialogue from Scream  \n- On-screen IPA/transcription and notation of reductions & linking  \n- Sentences and phrases you can pause and repeat with your own voice  \n- Bonus: Halloween-themed clip to make pronunciation study more fun!\n\n💡 How to get the most from this lesson:\n1. Watch the clip once without stopping to get the “feel” of the clip.  \n2. Re-watch with the on-screen IPA and notation, and pause when needed — try to imitate exactly.  \n3. Record yourself saying the same lines and compare your rhythm, linking and reductions with the original.  \n4. Try using variations of the phrase in your own conversations: how would you say it?\n\n👍 If you liked this lesson, don’t forget to subscribe and hit the bell for new videos every week.  \n\nHappy studying — and happy Halloween! 👻 \n\nLearn more: https://rachelsenglish.com/how-do-americans-really-speak-%f0%9f%91%bbscream-movie-%f0%9f%98%b1clip-english-pronunciation-analysis-%f0%9f%8e%83-halloween-special-%f0%9f%8e%83/\n\n00:00 Introduction \n00:06 Full pronunciation analysis of the movie, Scream\n00:31 The scene\n01:13 The Analysis\n08:35 Free Course \n42:22 The conversation \n43:11 Listening/Speaking training\n56:58 Free Course \n57:12 Subscribe with notifications on \n\n⭐️Get my free guide to the sounds of American English: https://rachelsenglish.com/cheat-sheet\n⭐️Get my Book: http://RachelsEnglish.com/book \n⭐️Follow me on Facebook: http://bit.ly/RE_FB \n⭐️I’m also on Instagram :) http://www.instagram.com/RachelsEnglish\n⭐️Join my YouTube Membership: https://www.youtube.com/rachelsenglish/join\n\nJoin Rachel's Circle or Rachel's Superstars for awesome YouTube perks!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/RachelsEnglish/join\nStudy in Rachel's online school to speak better, more confident English: https://www.RachelsEnglishAcademy.com\n\nGet your FREE Sounds of American English Cheat Sheet:  https://www.RachelsEnglish.com/cheat-sheet\n\nSUBSCRIBE!: http://bit.ly/RE_sub\n\n\nNew to Rachel's English?

The amount of fruit produced this year has been outstanding to say the least, with much larger than usual crops of both apples and damsons, both of which grow freely right here in the garden. The mild and wet spring as well as the hot and at times rainy summer have helped to produce an almost overwhelming amount of fruit. There is an interesting word we can use to describe something that is more than usual, especially when we are talking about quantity. We can use the word ‘bumper’ to describe this particular occurrence.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years. Have fun learning English as a second language.

    "description": "In this English lesson, you’ll learn how to describe bad behaviour in English using phrases that English speakers use every day. Sometimes people disappoint us, say unkind things, or act selfishll and it’s helpful to know how to talk about those situations clearly and politely in English.\n\nWe’ll look at common expressions such as to disappoint someone, to let someone down, and to hurt someone’s feelings. You’ll also learn expressions like to talk behind someone’s back, to throw someone under the bus, and to take advantage of someone. I'll make sure that each phrase includes clear examples so you can understand both the meaning and how to use it naturally in conversation.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll feel more confident talking about bad behaviour in English in your next English conversation!

    "description": "In this English lesson you’ll learn five common ways to say that you don’t want to do something. Native speakers use these short and natural expressions all the time when they’re tired, unmotivated, or just not interested. By the end of this lesson you’ll know how to recognize them and use them yourself in everyday conversations.\n\nIn this lesson you’ll hear examples of: \nI don’t want to – the most direct way to say no.\nI don’t feel like it – when you simply don’t have the desire.\nI’d rather not – a more polite refusal.\nI can’t be bothered – a casual way to say you don’t have the energy.\nI don’t feel up to it – when you’re too tired or unwell to do something.\n\nI’ll give you simple definitions, clear example sentences, and helpful pronunciation so you can feel confident using these phrases the next time you need to say no in English.\n\nI hope you enjoy this English lesson about not wanting to do something! Have a great day!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with the English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.

    "description": "Is it possible to speak without saying anything? Can we really use words without actually putting across any message? You might be surprised to find out that it is possible to speak without conveying any real meaning. A person might talk for a long period of time using various types of sentences. However, the things they say have very little value. Those words are merely being used to fill up a certain moment. There are many situations where this might happen. In English, we often refer to this as a ‘word salad’. A person speaks without conveying any important information. Quite often this occurs when someone has been put in a difficult position, where an answer to an awkward question is required.  #learnenglish #englishlanguage #speakenglish \n\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "In this English lesson, I’ll teach you 8 common phrases we use to describe the kinds of things that people do that are a bit annoying. From bosses at work to parents at home, these expressions will help you talk about annoying behavior in English in a natural way.\n\nIn this free English class you'll learn these phrases:\n\n-to nitpick: to complain about small, unimportant details.\n-to be on someone’s case: to pressure or remind someone repeatedly about something.\n-to micromanage: to control every small step of someone’s work instead of trusting them.\n-to split hairs: to argue over tiny details that don’t really matter.\n-to harp on someone: to complain about the same thing again and again.\n-to look over someone’s shoulder: to closely watch or supervise someone while they work.\n-to hound someone: to keep pressuring or bothering someone about something.\n-to pick something apart: to point out all the mistakes or flaws in something.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to recognize these expressions and use them in your own conversations. These are very natural phrases that native English speakers use all the time, so learning them will help you sound more fluent.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this English lesson about annoying people!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

    "description": "In this English lesson you’ll learn useful phrases and expressions we use when talking about procrastination and doing things late. I’ll explain what it means to procrastinate, to put something off, to do something at the last minute, and many other natural phrases.\n\nYou’ll hear real-life examples like renewing a passport too late, not changing lanes soon enough to make an exit, or dragging your feet when you don’t feel like cleaning the house. These phrases will help you understand everyday English conversations and describe your own habits more clearly.\n\nWe’ll also look at common words and expressions connected to deadlines and time pressure, such as cutting it close, to waste time, and to run out of time.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to talk about procrastination with confidence and recognize these expressions when native speakers use them.

Feelings of happiness will appear and disappear. The existence of a certain thing will be around for a period of time... until \rit disappears. People will come into your life and be part of your daily existence. Something you own will be yours. And you will treasure that thing until it is no longer there. Things come and things go. This is part\rof life. Some thing vanish suddenly, while other things slowly disappear.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "What is an antonym? We are looking at using opposite words. When we talk about opposite words, we mean words that are the reverse or as the name suggests, opposite things that go the other way. So we often talk about direction, or maybe one person is going that way and the other person is going that way. We can say they are going in opposite directions. The same thing is true with English words. There are words that can go one way, and of course there are words that express the opposite meaning. We will look at some of them.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years. Have fun learning English as a second language.

You’ll learn how to say to have a renewed interest, to breathe new life into something, to fall in love with something again, and more! These are English phrases that native speakers use to talk about revisiting old hobbies, returning to routines, or simply staying committed.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this English lesson.

In this sixth lesson, I explain what exactly happens on a stressed word. The key is to lengthen the vowel sound. A stressed vowel sound is longer, louder, and at a high pitch.\n\nWill we get to vowel and consonant sounds as well as intonation and linking? Yes! A lot of fun pronunciation activities are coming up as well as we start to put everything together. \n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Preview\n0:36 Intro\n4:52 Additional practice with stressed words and stressed syllables.\n5:33 Where to gain more practice with me\n\nThanks to Nitish for coming on camera with me!

Something that you might see often is commonly seen.

    "description": "#englishwithjennifer #accentreduction #americanenglish \nFollow the journey of Nitish, a real student from India, and learn to reduce the influence of your first language in order to speak English more clearly. In this fifth lesson, I stress the importance of not rushing when we speak. We need to remain in control of our articulation. We slow down and articulate our key words more carefully.\n\nWill we get to vowel and consonant sounds as well as intonation and linking? Yes, attention to word stress, individual sounds, intonation and other aspects is coming up in this series, but I needed to emphasize the importance of clarity over speed. Nitish, like many other advanced students of English, tends to rush, and the fast rate of speech has negatively impacted comprehensibility. However, by slowing down just a bit, he's already improved!\n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Preview\n0:35 Intro\n1:20 Learning to slow down and articulate words more clearly\n6:43 Where to gain more practice with me\n\nThanks to Nitish for coming on camera with me!

In this English class I'll give you several examples that you can use in everyday conversations.\n\nI'll help you learn common English questions to ask about places, people, names, and things using embedded questions. You'll learn phrases like: Do you know where my car keys are?, Do you know where the bathrooms are?,  I wonder what her name is., Do you know where my phone is?, Do you know who that is?, and many more!\n\nFinally, I'll help you learn about other verbs you can use in embedded questions, not just “is” or “are.” For example: Do you know what that was?, Do you know what to do?, Do you know where we should go?, and Do you know what you want?\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll know some common English questions and statements that you can use in your next English conversation.\n\nHave a great day!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.

    "description": "A person might be fussy about what they eat to be fussy about something means choosy. You are very choosy about what you like. I only eat certain types of food. I am very fussy about what I eat and people can be very fussy about the types of food they eat. They will only eat certain things. A person might only eat certain types of food. We might describe this person as a fussy eater, a person who is a fussy eater is a person who chooses very carefully the types of food they eat. I like that food, but I don't like that food. I like to eat that, but I don't like to eat that. A person can be a fussy eater. They choose the food they eat very carefully. A person might dislike a certain food because of the way it is produced or what it consists of. So there are many reasons why someone might dislike a type of food. Perhaps what it is, the way it is produced. So there might be other reasons besides taste. It is not just the flavour of the food that might be a problem, it might also be the way in which it is produced or what it is made of.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "Tit for tat is used to refer to a situation in which an action or retaliation is equivalent to the action that is done in response to something. In other words, put simply, I do something to you. You do a similar thing in retaliation to me. Two people are fighting, arguing. They are having some sort of battle or war. So I do that. You do that, then I do that, then you do that. The things that we do to each other will be similar. They have similar consequences. Tit for tat is what we often refer to it as. To retaliate means to hit back or return the attack with a similar response. So I do something to you. You return. You retaliate by doing something back at me. To retaliate means to hit back or return the attack with a similar response. The retaliation. So when we talk about the retaliation, we are describing the situation where a response is taking place.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "TRANSCRIPT - Here's an interesting word that I've heard used recently by one or two political commentators. The word is dogma. Oh, Mr. Duncan, does it have anything to do with dogs? Well, I can safely say the word dogma has nothing to do with dogs whatsoever. Dogma is a noun. It is an official system of principles or tenets concerning faith, morals, behaviour and so on. For example, those of the church. So we often see dogma as maybe a set of rules or principles that are put forward by a certain group or organization. Dogma quite often something that is accepted as being part of that particular thing. Normally in the form of rules, things that have been laid down as rules. We might also say it is prescribed doctrine proclaimed as unquestionably true by a particular group. So again when we look at dogma we are talking about rules things that are put forward. Also it is something that generally is accepted by a group of people as well. A settled or established opinion, belief or principle is often referred to as dogma. Interestingly enough, interestingly enough, interestingly enough, nothing to do with dogs. Isn't that amazing? Dogmatic is the adjective form of the word. So if you are holding dogma as one's belief or direction, we can say that person is dogmatic. They will often follow rules or principles as their guide in life. And this of course can refer to many things not only religion but it can be anyone's principles any thing or their direction the direction of a person how they see themselves and the rules that bind their existence or life. So it can also exist I suppose in politics as well. You can have dogma in politics. A person can be dogmatic with their principles. And the word originates, by the way, for those wondering, the word dogma originates from Greek to mean what seems good or the way to think. So dogma itself is just way of thinking what appears to be the best way to think and that is how that particular word evolved over the years. So there it is, today's interesting word, dogma. And as I said, it has absolutely nothing nothing at all to do with dogs.\n\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

First, watch for \"dangling\" modifiers -- these kinds of reduced adverb clauses with a participle must have the same subject as the main clause. Second, be careful with subject-verb agreement. Finally, coordinated pairs of words (with \"and\"/\"or\") as well as lists must have parallel structure.

    "description": "(SCRIPT) ----\nThere are two important things that\nwe all must do in our day to day lives.\n\nThe first is to be understood.\n\nThe word understood is the\npast tense of understand.\n\nThe act of letting other people know\nexactly what you mean is in important.\n\nIn daily life, you want to be understood.\n\nAnd of course, the other people around you\nneed to understand what it is you are saying.\n\nSometimes we might try to get another\nperson to understand what we are saying.\n\nWe will try our best to explain\nsomething as clearly as possible.\n\nOf course, in this situation it is\nimportant that the other person is listening.\n\nYou might say that most conversations\ninvolve more than one action.\n\nThe action of expressing and listening\nboth take place during any type of conversation,\n\nwhether you are speaking to\none individual or a whole crowd of people,\n\nthe same rule applies.\n\nYou have to make sure your message is clear\n\nand those around you must be listening.\n\nTo listen is to give your attention\nto what is being said.\n\nI'm sure you have been in\nthis situation yourself.\n\nThere you are, trying to explain\nsomething to another person.\n\nYou are being as clear as you can\nin your explanation.\n\nHowever, the person you are speaking to\nis not listening to what you are saying.\n\nThe other person is not paying attention.\n\nTo pay attention is to give your\nwhole observance to a particular thing.\n\nYou pay attention to something.\n\nYou give your full concentration\nto what is happening around you.\n\nThe opposite of this is often expressed as\n'not giving your full attention' or 'not paying attention'.\n\nSomeone is talking to you,\nbut you are not concentrating on them.\n\nYour mind is elsewhere.\n\nYou are not giving your full attention.\n\nThere are many reasons why this might happen.\n\nPerhaps you are distracted by something else.\n\nMaybe you have something on your mind\nand it is making it hard for you to concentrate.\n\nPerhaps the other person is talking\nabout something you have no interest in.\n\nWe often view this type of behaviour\nas rude and disrespectful.\n\nThere is an interesting phrase that expresses the feeling\nof talking to someone who is clearly not listening to you.\n\nYou might say talking to you is\n'like talking to a brick wall'.\n\nThis phrase clearly shows that you are\nannoyed by the other person's behaviour.\n\nClearly they are not listening\nto what you are saying.\n\nYou might as well be talking to a brick wall.\n\nPerhaps someone is not taking your advice.\n\nThey are ignoring your suggestions and because of that,\nthey keep making the same mistakes over and over again.\n\nYou can say that your advice is 'falling on deaf ears'.\n\nEverything you have said has been ignored.\n\nOnce again, you might also say that\n'it is like talking to a brick wall'.\n\nAll of your good advice has been wasted.\n\nThe other person is not listening\nto what you are saying.\n\n\"Are you even listening to what I'm saying?\"\n\n\"I might as well be talking to a brick wall.\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "Here is an interesting word that we often use\nwhen we want to express how special something is.\n\nPerhaps you are trying to sell something,\n\nand you wish to express just\nhow unique that particular thing is.\n\nPerhaps it is something that only\na certain number of people can have or obtain.\n\nToday's interesting word is 'exclusive'.\n\nThe word 'exclusive' can be used in many ways\nand in various situations.\n\nAs an adjective, the word exclusive means\nexcluding or not admitting other things.\n\nBy this we mean one thing has the right\nor the authority to reject others.\n\nTo exclude means to push certain things aside.\n\nYou might say that excluding is a type of reject.\n\nSo in this sense, if something is exclusive,\nit means only a few things will be allowed in.\n\nA person's thinking can be exclusive,\n\nif they are only concentrating\non one certain subject or aim,\n\na person might have an exclusive\nfocus on becoming successful.\n\nThey will push all negativity aside.\n\nThey will only concentrate\non the things that will help them.\n\nThis type of thinking is exclusive.\n\nA certain method of learning\nmight be described as exclusive.\n\nAll parts of the subject are going\nto be studied without any distractions.\n\nTo completely focus on something\nin a direct way is exclusive.\n\nSomething that is restricted to one person,\na group, or an area concerned is exclusive.\n\nYou can have exclusive possession of something.\n\nYou are the only person that\nowns that particular thing.\n\nFor example, you can have\nexclusive ownership of a property.\n\nNo other person can claim ownership\nof that particular property.\n\nSomething that is available to only a few select people\n\nand quite often is considered high class\nor sophisticated, might be described as 'exclusive'.\n\nAn exclusive hotel.\n\nThis hotel is exclusive.\n\nOnly certain people can afford\nto stay at this place,\n\nthus making it exclusive for the wealthy.\n\nWe can also use exclusive\nto define, 'not including'.\n\nThat is to say, something has been left out.\n\nIt has not been included.\n\nThe prices of the food on\nthe menu are exclusive of tax.\n\nThis means that the extra tax has not been\nincluded in the prices on the menu.\n\nAs a noun, the word exclusive means an item or story\npublished or broadcast by only one source.\n\nFor example, one particular newspaper has some information\nand is going to publish it as an exclusive.\n\nIt is their exclusive story.\n\nThe story is an exclusive.\n\nNo one else has the information.\n\nThe newspaper has the exclusive.\n\nIt is their big story.\n\nWe often relate this word to 'exclude'\nas in 'push away' or 'shut out',\n\nwhich is where the word 'exclusive' originates from.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "SCRIPT... \n\nOne of the most common problems that\nwe all find at some point in our lives\n\nis having enough money to cover\nthose unexpected events.\n\nMany people like to save money\nfor such an occurrence.\n\nThey might have a special\nemergency fund that they keep aside\n\nfor those moments that may\ncome suddenly out of the blue.\n\nTo come 'out of the blue' means\nto appear without warning.\n\nSomething you are not expecting\nto happen comes out of the blue.\n\nThere is a lovely phrase that we use to describe\nthe action of putting money aside for emergencies.\n\nWe often say that we are saving\nthat money 'for a rainy day'.\n\nThe rainy day, of course, is the problem.\n\nA moment of time when something\nunexpected occurs.\n\nThat is the rainy day.\n\nPerhaps an unexpected bill\narrives on your doorstep.\n\nThat money put aside will come in\nvery useful to pay off the debt\n\nwithout having to worry too much about it.\n\nPerhaps a serious problem occurs\nwith something in your house.\n\nMaybe some emergency repairs\nhave to be carried out.\n\nOnce again, that money you have put aside\nwill help you pay for that work to be done.\n\nThe rainy day might also be your general future.\n\nA small amount of money that you have put aside or invested\nin some way will come in useful later on in your life.\n\nWe can also describe this type of saving as a nest egg.\n\nSomething put aside for that unexpected\nmoment that might just crop up out of the blue.\n\nThe phrase 'crop up' means appear or occur,\nquite often in an unexpected way.\n\nA problem might crop up.\n\nSomething crops up suddenly,\nthus creating a problem.\n\nThat is the reason why having something put by\nor saved in a safe place is a wise thing to do.\n\nYou are keeping something back 'for a rainy day'.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years.

    "description": "Sometimes it is possible to know something just by observing or watching closely. A small detail that was observed might give away lots of clues to something. To give away is to reveal something.\nIt has been given away. In this sense, we are using the phrase 'give away' to mean 'show' or 'tell' someone something that would have been otherwise hidden. You might 'give away' the answer to a question. You might 'give away' a secret to someone that should not have been told. A person trying to hide something might accidentally 'give away' their secret. Today's word relates to this event occurring. The word is 'inkling'. What does 'inkling' mean?\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years. Have fun learning English as a second language.

    "description": "All languages consist of many different types of words, each with their own individual meaning. Some of those words have positive meanings, whilst others have negative meanings. For some reason, many people learning a language find they are more interested in the negative words rather than the positive ones. There is a strange curiosity that exists into how other languages express those darker sides of our personalities. Today's word is a common one. It is a word that can be used as both a noun and a verb. This intriguing word is a CHEAT. In general terms, the word cheat means mislead or trick someone into doing or believing something. To make a promise that will not be carried out is cheat.\n\nMr Duncan has been teaching English for free on YouTube for over 18 years. Have fun learning English as a second language.

    "description": "Another useful English lesson for you. Over the years, I have received THOUSANDS of questions concerning the process of learning the English language. Many of these questions relate not only to the language itself, but also about the methods and secrets of picking up the language. It would appear that many students worry more about the process of learning English, rather than the actual subject itself.

In my experience Preply is a great way to take your English language learning to the next level!\n\nIn this English lesson we'll learn about people's flaws. In a previous English class I talked about virtues. Flaws are sort of the opposite. They are the negative characteristics of people. The types of things that other people find annoying or aggravating.\n\nIn this English lesson you'll learn vocabulary like: laziness, short temper, overconfidence, gossiping, perfectionism, cowardice, envy, jealousy, procrastination, neglectfulness, pessimism, greed, and many more!\n\nI hope you enjoy this free English class about describing people's flaws. Have a great day!\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!\n\n--\n\n✅ Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:\n😀💲 If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join\n\nBecoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:\n1) For 10 minutes during each live stream you will be able to participate in the \"Members Only\" chat.\n2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.\n3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.\n4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, \"Wednesdays with Bob\".

Of course, we will still be taking a look at some words from the English language, after all that is why we are here together right now. I thought today we would look at some words that sound the same but are spelt differently. They also have very different meanings. They are also often used in well known English phrases.
