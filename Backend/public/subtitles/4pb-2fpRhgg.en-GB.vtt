00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.080
From BBC Learning English.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.800
This is Learning English from the News,
our podcast about the news headlines.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.000
In this programme:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.440
Solar and wind power now generate
more electricity than coal

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.320
for the first time ever.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.640
Hello, I'm Georgie.
And I'm Phil.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.400
In this programme,
we look at one big news story

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080
and the vocabulary in the headlines
that will help you understand it.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.800
You can find all the vocabulary
and headlines from this episode,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.880
as well as a worksheet
on our website, bbclearningenglish.com

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
So let's hear more about this story.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.560
For the first time ever,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.480
more electricity has been generated
through wind and solar power

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.160
than from coal power plants.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.960
That's according to a new report.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
The amount of electricity used globally
has increased since last year,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.880
but 100% of that increase has
been met by renewable energy sources.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.920
In the last year,
solar power generation has increased

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.080
by a third and wind power by 7%.
China and India are responsible

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.360
for a large part
of this growth of renewable energy.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.600
Europe and the US actually increased
their coal and gas power generation.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.200
58% of solar generation
is now in lower-income countries.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.760
It's been predicted that renewable
energy generation could double

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.360
by the end of the decade.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.160
Let's have our first headline.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.640
This one is
from The Guardian in the UK.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.280
Global renewable energy generation
surpasses coal for first time.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.040
That headline
again from The Guardian

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.160
in the UK: Global renewable
energy generation surpasses coal

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.720
for first time.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.560
Now this headline is comparing renewable
ways of generating energy with coal.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.840
We're going to learn
the word 'surpass'.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.640
Yes, surpass is a verb and it means
to be more than or to exceed.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.480
Here it's saying
that the amount of energy generated

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.400
through renewable means is greater than
the amount generated by burning coal.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.560
It is quite formal, so we're more
likely to see it in written English.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
It's often used with numbers and
figures to compare them. For example,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.000
the estimated global population
has now surpassed eight billion.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.960
It can also be used to say that
something is better than something else.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.560
Her talent has surpassed
all those who came before her.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560
The word 'surpasses' includes
the prefix 'sur' - S-U-R,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.640
which we often use
to mean over or more.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.840
For example, a surcharge is
when you have to pay more.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.360
If you survive,
you live for more time.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.840
We've had surpass - to be more than
or to be better than.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.840
For example, the runner surpassed his
previous best time by three seconds.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.520
This is Learning English

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.480
from the News, our podcast
about the news headlines.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.120
We're talking about the fact

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.600
that more energy is now being
generated globally by renewable means

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.800
than by coal.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960
And here's our next headline.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.720
This one is from Semafor,
an American news website.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.520
Renewables overtake coal as world's
primary source of electricity.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.720
That headline again,
renewables overtake coal

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440
as world's primary source
of electricity.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.760
And that's from Semafor,
an American news website.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.080
Now, the headline says
that renewables have overtaken -

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.880
that means the same
as surpassed - coal.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.440
We're going to learn 'primary source'.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.720
Yes. The primary source of something
is where most of it comes from.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.240
When we talk about the primary source
of electricity,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.720
we mean where
the largest amount of it comes from.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.120
The phrase primary source can be used
in many different contexts.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.320
So I could say that the primary
source of fibre in my diet is fruit.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.480
Or you could talk about
the world's primary source of gold.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.160
You're just saying
where the largest amount comes from.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.480
Now, primary source is quite formal.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.320
You'll see it in news reports,
but not so much in everyday speech.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.840
We've had primary source - where the
largest amount of something comes from.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.960
For example,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.880
Cars are the primary source
of pollution in this city.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.160
This is Learning English from the News,
our podcast about the news headlines.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.680
Today we've been talking
about how renewable energy has become

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.240
the world's primary source
of electricity.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.520
And here's our next headline.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.160
This is from AP news:

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.720
Solar and wind power has grown faster
than electricity demand this year,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.880
report says.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.640
And that headline again from AP news:

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.880
Solar and wind power has grown faster
than electricity demand this year,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.320
report says.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.800
So this headline compares the growth
of solar and wind power

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.160
with the demand for electricity.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.480
And the noun demand is
what we're going to learn next.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.880
Yes. So the verb demand is
very common

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.440
and means to ask
for something forcefully.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.200
But as a noun, we use it to talk
about an economic concept.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.360
Demand for something is how much
of something people actually want.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.400
Yes, the demand for electricity is
how much electricity people want.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.760
Developments
in technology can affect this.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.920
If more people buy electric cars, there
will be more demand for electricity.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.800
And from this noun we get the phrase
'in demand'.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.000
If something is in demand,
lots of people want it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.120
For example, around Halloween,
pumpkins are in demand.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.560
We had demand - how much
people want something. For example,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.000
High energy bills have led to demand
for more efficient heating systems.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.800
That's it for this episode
of Learning English from the News.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.920
We'll be back next week
with another news story.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.720
