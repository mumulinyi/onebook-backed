00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.560
Hello, this is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.680
And I'm Phil.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.720
Phil, do you believe
there's life on other planets?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.400
Well, there's a lot of other planets,
so yeah, I think there must be.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.600
Yeah, I agree.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.120
Well, it's a question that interests
American astrophysicist Adam Frank,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.120
who discussed it
with his colleague Gavin Schmidt,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.880
director of NASA's Institute
for Space Studies.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360
Here, Adam recalls their conversation

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.520
for BBC World Service programme
CrowdScience:

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
We know that there's been
no other civilisation on Earth,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.120
and he stopped me and said,
How do you know that?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.640
And my jaw just dropped down
to the floor.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.520
Adam's jaw dropped – an idiom for when
someone looks shocked and surprised.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.960
Could there have been a technologically
advanced civilisation before us,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.200
here on Earth?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.800
It may sound weird
but this idea has a scientific name.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Here is Caroline Steel, presenter
of BBC's CrowdScience, to explain:

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.680
The Silurian hypothesis proposes
that if there was

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.080
a technologically advanced civilisation
hundreds of millions of years ago,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.240
we wouldn't be able
to find traces of it.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.360
A hypothesis is an idea
which explains how something happens

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.720
and can be tested to find out
if it's correct.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.320
In this episode, we'll be discussing
the Silurian hypothesis:

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.920
the idea that a technologically
advanced civilisation

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.880
existed before us on Earth

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.160
but vanished without leaving a trace.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.400
As usual, we'll be learning
some useful new words and idioms,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.920
and remember –
you'll find all the vocabulary

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.960
on our website,
bbclearningenglish.com.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.320
But first,
I have a question for you, Phil.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.680
Human civilisation is thousands
of years old

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520
but the planet itself is much older.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.320
So, how old does do scientists think
the Earth is?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080
Is it: a) 3.5 billion years,
b) 4.5 billion years,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800
or c) 5.5 billion years.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.440
I'm going to guess
c) 5.5 billion years.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.400
OK. Well, we will find the answer out
later in the programme.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.520
To believe a technologically
advanced civilisation existed

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.640
on Earth hundreds of millions
of years ago,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.800
most people
would probably want evidence.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.680
We have evidence about other species
from the past, such as the dinosaurs,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.200
from fossils –
the remains of prehistoric plants

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.920
or animals that have been preserved
in rock for a very long time.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.880
But according to Adam Frank,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.440
fossils won't help prove
the Silurian hypothesis,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.320
as he explains here to BBC
World Service programme CrowdScience.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720
Most things are not fossilised.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.560
It's only a tiny fraction of Earth's
life that has ever become fossilised.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.240
So, imagine that you have
a 10,000-year-long civilisation,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.360
which is a blink of the eye
for geology –

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.360
that's too short
to really create a lot of fossils.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.160
Adam argues that only a tiny fraction –
meaning a very small amount –

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.960
of life on Earth
has turned into fossil.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.760
In geological time,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.840
even a 10,000-year-old civilisation is
the blink of an eye –

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.280
an idiom meaning
a very short period of time.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.480
In other words, older civilisations
might have existed on Earth

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480
but not for long enough
to leave fossilised evidence.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.160
However, not everyone is convinced by
Adam's ideas.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.360
Evidence of our own civilisation,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.280
including plastics
and man-made materials like concrete,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.680
is already being layered
into the Earth's crust,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.520
and these are going to last
a very long time.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.680
So, surely a technologically
advanced civilisation from prehistory

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.800
would have left similar marks.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.680
Well, here's Adam Frank again,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.280
answering these objections on BBC
World Service programme CrowdScience.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.320
What happens is somebody else
will pick up on their work,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.280
either affirming it and showing new
evidence for it or pushing back on it,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.880
and once you get to, like, 20,
30 or 40 papers,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.680
then you have a consensus.
You're like, OK.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000
We've really, really looked at this
and now we know.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.360
Adam welcomes new evidence, even
evidence which contradicts his ideas,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.320
as part of the scientific method needed
to prove a hypothesis right or wrong.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.680
It's how scientists form a consensus –
meaning a general agreement –

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.840
about the issue.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.400
Personally, I think the idea
of prehistoric civilisations on Earth

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.720
is so mysterious,
it's OK to keep an open mind.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.160
Now, isn't it time you revealed
the answer to your question, Beth?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.240
I think it is.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.200
I asked you, How old
do scientists think the Earth is?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.760
You said, 5.5 billion years,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760
and I'm afraid you were wrong, Phil.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.480
It's 4.5 billion years.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.080
OK. Let's recap the vocabulary we've
learnt, starting with the idiom,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.600
my jaw dropped,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.720
which is used to say someone looks
very shocked and surprised.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.520
A hypothesis is a suggestion
that's proposed to explain something,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.400
which can then be tested to see
if it's true.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.080
Fossils are the remains
of prehistoric plants or animals

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.280
that have been preserved in rock
for a very long time.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.720
A tiny fraction of something is
a very small amount of it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.920
The idiom the blink of an eye
means a very short period of time.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.520
And finally,
a consensus is a general agreement.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.400
Once again, our six minutes are up
but if you're keen for more,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.400
then head over to our website,
bbclearningenglish.com,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.760
where you'll find a worksheet
and a quiz for this episode.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.600
See you again soon.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.760
But for now, it's goodbye!
Goodbye.
