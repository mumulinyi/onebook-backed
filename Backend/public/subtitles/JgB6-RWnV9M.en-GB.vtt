00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.920
Hello. Welcome to Real Easy English.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400
In this podcast we have real conversations&nbsp;
in easy English to help you learn.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.200
I'm Neil.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.560
And I'm Georgie. Remember, if you&nbsp;
want read along to this podcast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.979
you can find a script on our website&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.240
Hi, Georgie. How are you doing?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm fine thanks, Neil. How are you?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm very well, thank you.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640
What's today's conversation about, Neil?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.520
Today, we're going to talk about travel.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.880
We talked about holidays
in another episode,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.600
but today we'll talk about everyday travel
and compare our journeys to work.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.680
So, Neil,
what is your journey to work like?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.120
Well, because we live in London
and it's a big city, it's quite long.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.200
But I get a bus to a tube stop.
The tube is the underground train.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.360
And then I get the tube
to near the BBC and then I walk.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.520
Nice. I walk to work.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.840
I don't like using the tube,
the underground train,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.800
because there's so many people on it.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.160
I prefer to get some fresh air
in the morning.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.306
Ah, you walk to work!
That's interesting in London.

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.280
— Mm-hm.
— Tell me about your walk to work.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.160
Well, my walk starts with walking along
some streets, towards a park,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.560
and then I walk across a park and then
I walk through some more streets,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.400
because there is a little bit of time
between the park and the office

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.720
and then I arrive at the office.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.120
Very nice.
So you don't like public transport?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.840
Mm, I use it sometimes
when there's an emergency,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.000
like if it's raining
or if I don't have time.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.520
But, if I have time,
I like to walk to work.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560
And how long does your journey take?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.400
My journey takes me one hour if I walk

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.560
and 30 minutes if I take the tube.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.800
— That's pretty good for London.
— What about you?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.640
My journey takes at least an hour,
sometimes more.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.600
And Neil, you have to get a bus
and a train. What's your journey like?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.040
Well, it can be good, but sometimes
there's traffic jams on the roads

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.800
and so the bus can take a long time.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920
But once I get onto the tube,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.600
it's usually OK as I travel across London.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.880
Ooh, Neil, can you explain
what we mean by traffic jam?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.160
Yeah, so a 'traffic jam' is when there are
too many cars and buses on the road

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.760
and so the traffic can't move very quickly
or can't move at all.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.480
Oh, yeah, traffic jams are so rubbish.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.080
Are there times of the day
when there are more traffic jams?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.880
Yes, so during rush hour.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.400
'Rush hour' is when most people
are going to work so the roads are busier.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.480
And also, if it's the 'school run',
school run time,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.960
so lots of people on the roads,
taking their kids to school,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.400
then the bus journey takes a long time.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.360
OK. So, that's in the morning
and in the afternoons?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.360
Yeah. That's right.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.080
Well, Georgie, your journey to work sounds
nicer than mine, probably more relaxing.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.720
Yes. Not when it's raining, though!

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.640
Let's recap the words
we learned during the conversation.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.120
We had 'towards' —
'travelling in the direction of'.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.840
'Across' —
'travelling from one side to the other'.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.480
'Rush hour' — 'a time when a lot of people
are moving around the city,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.200
'usually for work or school'.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.520
And an expression for something I hate —
'traffic jam',

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.029
which we use to talk about
'a big delay when you're driving'.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.520
