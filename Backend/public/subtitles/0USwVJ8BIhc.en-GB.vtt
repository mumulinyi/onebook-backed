00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.880
From BBC Learning English,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.120
this is Learning English from the News,
our podcast about the news headlines.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.200
In this programme,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.800
the strongest storm of the year,
Hurricane Melissa, hits the Caribbean.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.760
Hello, I'm Beth.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.080
And I'm Phil.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.560
In this programme,
we look at one big news story

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.640
and the vocabulary in the headlines
that will help you understand it.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.200
You can find all the vocabulary
and headlines from this episode,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.680
as well as
a worksheet on our website,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.920
bbclearningenglish.com.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.200
OK, so let's hear more
about this story, Phil.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240
Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica
on Tuesday

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.640
as a category five storm with violent
winds that reached a high of 295km/h.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.840
It's also now hit Cuba.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.160
The Jamaican prime minister has
declared the country a 'disaster area'

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.920
and warns of 'devastating impacts'.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.800
It will take time to know
exactly how bad the damage is

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.040
but we know homes and hospitals
have been badly affected

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.000
and there is severe flooding
across Jamaica.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's the strongest storm
on Earth so far this year,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.560
and is one of the strongest storms
in the Atlantic Ocean this century.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.680
Our first headline is
about the hurricane.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.960
Hurricane Melissa makes landfall
in Jamaica,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.640
and that's from The Guardian,
a newspaper in the UK.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.560
That headline again, Hurricane
Melissa makes landfall in Jamaica.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.080
And that's from The Guardian,
a British newspaper.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.040
So this headline says
Hurricane Melissa has made landfall.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400
And that's the phrase
we're going to look at.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.760
We know 'land' and 'fall' already,
but this is one word.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.560
So Phil, what does it mean?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.440
Well, it means the moment when
something travelling across the sea

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.840
or air reaches the land,
'make' turns it into a verb,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.520
so 'make landfall' means reach land.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.520
So this headline is saying
the hurricane has reached land.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.960
It's hit Jamaica.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.600
Is this phrase often used
for hurricanes?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.520
Yes. You'll often see it in headlines
relating to storms, hurricanes,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.960
or tropical cyclones,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.520
because 'makes landfall' usually means
the moment where the damage begins

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.600
and people are really affected.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.160
We can use it for things other
than storms, though, can't we?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120
Yes. Another example could be
after two weeks at sea,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.520
the sailors finally made landfall.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.040
And we can also use it
metaphorically,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.880
although it's not as common.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.520
So for example, you could say
the business made landfall

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.760
in the tech market last year,
and that means the business arrived

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.640
and started to operate
in the tech market last year.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.640
We had 'make landfall' - reach land.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.720
For example,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
the storm made landfall in
the early hours of Saturday morning.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.600
This is Learning English

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.640
from the News, our podcast
about the news headlines. Today,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.240
we're talking about the hurricane
that has hit the Caribbean.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.240
Now the Caribbean Sea is currently
warmer than it normally is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.880
at this time of year
by a couple of degrees,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.520
which has made
this hurricane even more intense.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.400
There haven't been many big storms
in the Atlantic so far this season,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.200
and that means
the warm air and energy

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.840
in this area hasn't been used up
in previous storms.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.760
Because of climate change,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.640
warmer conditions like those
in the Caribbean Sea are more likely,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.200
and that makes more extreme
weather events more likely too.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.720
Our next headline is about the
relationship between climate change

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.600
and Hurricane Melissa.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.360
And this comes from AP News,
an international news agency.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.560
As the Atlantic Ocean warms,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.680
climate change is fuelling
Hurricane Melissa's ferocity.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.920
That headline again from AP news,
an international news agency.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.080
As the Atlantic Ocean warms,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.960
climate change is fuelling
Hurricane Melissa's ferocity.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.680
This headline connects climate change
and the strength of Hurricane Melissa.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.560
We're focusing
on the word 'fuelling'. Now,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.680
Phil, this makes me think
of petrol and coal.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.880
Well, the noun 'fuel; means a material
that produces energy when it burns

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.160
like coal, petrol or gas.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.960
If you literally fuel something,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.240
that's the verb,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.760
you give it the energy
or power to keep going.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.200
But here, 'fuel' is used metaphorically.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.160
The headline means climate change
is making the hurricanes stronger.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.600
It's intensifying it,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.200
but it's not literally giving fuel
to the hurricane.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.080
And the verb 'fuel' is often used
metaphorically in this way.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.200
We can use it to talk about things
that increase your emotion.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.200
For example, his anger fuelled the
argument and made everything worse.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.720
Or we can use it to talk about
increasing an activity like social media

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.520
can often fuel the spread of rumours.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.840
You might have noticed that the
examples we gave were not positive.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.520
'Fuel' often suggests adding energy or
momentum in a negative or dangerous way.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.040
We've had 'fuel'
- give energy to something.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.920
For example, the latest
political scandal has fuelled outrage

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.560
among the public.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.400
This is Learning English from the News,
our podcast about the news headlines.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.240
Today we're talking about Hurricane
Melissa, which has hit the Caribbean.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.320
A US Air Force Reserve crew known
as the 'Hurricane Hunters',

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.640
flew through the centre
of Hurricane Melissa

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.240
on Monday to collect data
for the National Hurricane Center.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.320
They recorded wind speeds
of up to 282km/h,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.880
and also filmed the centre
of the storm.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.440
Our next headline comes
from an article about this.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.360
Storm chasers fly
inside the eye of Hurricane Melissa,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.680
and that's from BBC News.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.040
That headline again.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.440
Storm chasers fly
inside the eye of Hurricane Melissa.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.760
And that's from BBC News.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.080
So, this headline describes
people known as storm chasers flying

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.920
into the middle of the hurricane.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.160
And we're focusing on 'the eye of'.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.560
The eye of the storm or hurricane

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.320
in this headline is an expression
that refers to the middle of the storm.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.560
The eye of a hurricane is actually
quite calm, and the air is quite still,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.640
while the heavy rainfall
and violent winds swirl around it.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.920
So, in this case, the headline
literally means the middle of the storm,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.880
which is where
storm chasers have been flying.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.280
However, it's very common to use
'the eye of the storm' metaphorically

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.440
in English to talk
about things other than weather,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.040
isn't it?
That's right.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.040
The phrase can be used to describe
a moment of calm in the middle of chaos.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.640
For example, the manager remained in
the eye of the storm even when she heard

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.600
there were going to be even more
difficult times ahead for her team.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.760
This means she remained calm.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.080
But we also often use it to mean
someone or something is

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.560
in the centre of a dramatic,
difficult or controversial situation.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.760
And in that case,
the centre isn't necessarily calm.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.160
So, for example, after pictures
of the politician were printed

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.520
in the papers, he found himself
in the eye of the storm.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.000
We've had 'the eye of the storm' -
the centre of a storm.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.080
For example,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.560
the eye of the storm passed right
through the middle of our town.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.320
That's it for this episode
of Learning English from the News.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.480
We'll be back next week
with another news story.
